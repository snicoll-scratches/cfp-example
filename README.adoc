= 10 ways to get super-productive with Spring Boot

This sample project is going to be used for a talk demoing how Spring Boot helps
you to be super-productive.

== Scenario

=== Schema update

Let's improve our `Speaker` entity so that we list the `github` account. It's very
simple really but using Flyway allows us to make sure the schema is upgraded
automatically on startup. Adding Flyway and putting the script at a default location
is enough.

=== Switch to a different database

It is very easy to create a `application-local.properties` configuration file and
point to a different database. In this example, we chose to deploy our app using MySQL
instead of the embedded H2 database.

`application-local.properties` can be ignored in `.gitignore` and only kept locally.
